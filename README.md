# LSTM Twitter Bio Generator

This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network implemented with Keras to generate Twitter bios based on existing data. It demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to text generation, offering a novel approach to creating engaging and relevant social media content.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone <repository-url>


2. **Install Dependencies**
Ensure Python and pip are installed on your system, then run:


3. **Data Preparation**
Place your training data CSV file in the root directory or modify the script to point to your data location.

## Usage

To train the model and generate Twitter bios:
```bash
python generate_bios.py
```

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Tokenizes and pads text data for LSTM training.
Model Training: Uses an LSTM model to learn from a large dataset of Twitter bios.
Bio Generation: Generates bios from seed text using the trained model.
Callbacks: Includes model checkpoints and early stopping to enhance training.
